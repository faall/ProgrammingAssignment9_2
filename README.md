## Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown and Leaflet

### Instructions

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

### Notes

In case you would like to reproduce the code check the Rmd file, I have also included the data sourse files in CSV format.
